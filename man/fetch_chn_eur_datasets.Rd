and OTP datasets.}

\item{years}{Optional integer vector of years for OTP. Defaults to all years
overlapping \verb{[wef, til]}.}

\item{include_weight}{Logical; fetch NM area weight segment counts.}

\item{include_market}{Logical; fetch NM area market segment counts.}

\item{include_regional}{Logical; fetch regional roll-up (PBWG schema).}

\item{include_airport}{Logical; fetch APDF airport traffic counts.}

\item{include_otp}{Logical; fetch OTP punctuality buckets.}

\item{out_dir}{Output directory; created if missing.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{TRUE} after writing requested datasets.
}
\description{
Downloads NM area traffic counts (weight and market segments), regional
roll-ups, APDF airport traffic counts, and OTP punctuality buckets for a date
window, writing each dataset to Parquet files for downstream CHN-EUR
reporting.
